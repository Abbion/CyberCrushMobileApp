Editor naming convention
	- For objects added to the scene tree, use snake_case.
	- Add all scripts to the script folder without adding _script at the end.

Code conventions
	- For class and enum names, use CamelCase.
	- For enum variable and constant names, use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
	- For variable names, use snake_case.
	- Long variable names are better than acronyms.
	- Try to use := for variable assignment when possible.
	- In the script header, abide by this order hierarchy:
		1. @export variables
		2. Constants
		3. @import
		4. Script variables
	- Don't use the _ prefix when creating a signal listener.
	- All server requests should be handled by the ServerRequest.gd script.
	- When handling errors, use PopupDisplayServer.push_error(simple, verbose) to inform the user.

Some files don't align with these rules but should be refactored in the future.
